# SnapDB
snapDB MockDB is a lightweight, file-based mock database built on top of the csv-for-you library. It stores collections as individual CSV files, making it ideal for quick prototyping, small-scale apps, and local development without requiring a full database setup.

üì¶ Installation
```bash
npm install csv-for-you```
Copy or import the MockDB class into your project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
Create CSV-backed collections with custom schema

Generate unique 24-character IDs for each record

Insert, retrieve, and delete records by ID

Delete entire collections

Get all collection names

Calculate total database size

## üìö Usage
Initialize Database
```js
const MockDB = require('./MockDB');
const db = new MockDB(); // defaults to "DATABASE" folder
```
Create a Collection
```js
await db.createCollection('users', ['name', 'email']);
```
Insert a Record
```js
const result = await db.insert('users', {
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@example.com'
});

console.log(result.newRecordId);
```
Retrieve a Collection
```js
const users = await db.getCollection('users');
console.log(users);
```
Find Record by ID
```js
const user = await db.findById('some_unique_id', 'users');
console.log(user);
```
Delete Record by ID
```js
await db.deleteById('some_unique_id', 'users');
```
Delete Collection
```js
await db.deleteCollectionByName('users');
```
Get All Collection Names
```js
const collections = await db.getCollectionNames();
console.log(collections);
```
Calculate Database Size

```js
const sizeInBytes = await db.calcDBSize();
console.log(`Database size: ${sizeInBytes} bytes`);
```

## üìÅ File Structure
Each collection is saved as a .csv file inside the specified database folder. The default location is a DATABASE directory in your current working directory.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Notes
The ID field is automatically generated and prepended to each record.

You cannot include id in your custom schema when creating a collection.

Records are stored as plain CSV with headers, one file per collection.

## üß™ Dependencies
csv-for-you, fs, path, and crypto (Node.js core modules)

## Future Features
1. Adding the bug reporter
2. Adding an error handler
3. Creating the PUT method to the DB
